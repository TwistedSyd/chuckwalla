# Fixes Applied to React Piano App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Home Page Not Loading First
**Problem:** The React app was replacing the main home page
**Fix:**
- Kept original `index.html` as the main landing page
- Built React app to `piano-react/dist/` subdirectory
- Added link to React version from home page

### 2. ✅ Navigation Icons Not Working
**Problem:** Navigation icons pointed to wrong paths
**Fix:** Updated Navigation.jsx to use absolute paths from root:
- `/index.html` → Home
- `/html/drums.html` → Drums
- `/html/piano.html` → Piano (HTML version)
- `/html/guitar.html` → Guitar
- `/html/circle-of-fifths.html` → Circle of Fifths

### 3. ✅ Vite Base Path Configuration
**Problem:** Assets wouldn't load correctly when deployed
**Fix:** Configured `vite.config.js` with `base: '/piano-react/'`

## Project Structure

```
/chuckwalla/
├── index.html              # Main home page (START HERE)
├── html/
│   ├── piano.html          # Original HTML piano
│   ├── drums.html
│   ├── guitar.html
│   └── circle-of-fifths.html
├── css/                    # Original CSS files
├── js/                     # Original JavaScript files
└── piano-react/
    ├── src/                # React source code
    ├── dist/               # Built React app (production)
    │   └── index.html      # React piano entry point
    └── package.json
```

## How to Access

### Option 1: Using a Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
# From the chuckwalla directory
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8000/**

The home page will show all instruments, with a "⚛️ Try React Version (Beta)" link on the Piano card.

### Option 2: Direct File Access
Open `/chuckwalla/index.html` in your browser, but note:
- Navigation between pages works
- The React version link points to `/piano-react/dist/index.html`

## Development Workflow

### For React Development
```bash
cd piano-react
npm run dev
# Development server runs on http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** During development (localhost:5173), navigation to parent site won't work because Vite serves only the React app. Navigation works in the built version.

### Building React App
```bash
cd piano-react
npm run build
# Outputs to piano-react/dist/
```

### After Making Changes
1. Make changes in `piano-react/src/`
2. Run `npm run build` from piano-react directory
3. The built files in `dist/` are what get served from the main site

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Main home page loads (`/index.html`)
- [ ] All instrument links work from home page
- [ ] Original HTML piano works (`/html/piano.html`)
- [ ] React piano loads from home page link
- [ ] Navigation icons in React app link back to other pages
- [ ] All piano features work (tabs, keyboard, MIDI, effects)

## Both Versions Available

- **HTML Version:** `/html/piano.html` - Original, fully functional
- **React Version:** `/piano-react/dist/index.html` - New React implementation

Both have identical functionality, just different tech stacks!
